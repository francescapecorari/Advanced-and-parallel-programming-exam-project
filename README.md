# Advanced-and-parallel-programming-exam-project
Repository containing the work done for the "Programmazione avanzata e parallela" course at the university of Trieste.

The first part consists in writing a program in C to create a "Mandelbrot fractal" netbpm image using greyscale colours.

The program is written using a makefile to better organize the code, OpenMP parallelization is used to improve performance and the image is saved using 'mmap.

The second part of the project is aimed to realize a system to build and evaluate expressions by exploiting the hierarchical definition of classes in python in order to avoid duplicating code. 

The expressions are written and processed using reverse polish notation.
Besides basic mathematical operations the program is able to process more complex expression that ask to allocate variable in the environment, perform cicles or biuld and execute subroutines.
